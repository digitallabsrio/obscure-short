  "course_name": "Exploring and Mastering the Full Go Featureset - Learn Interactively",
  "course_overview": "Go is a popular language known for its simplicity. For developers who lack a deep knowledge of its features, it's a great time to pick up the Go language. The differences between Go and other popular programming languages can lead to hours of Google for the newer software engineer. Mastering these surprising, sometimes delightful, sometimes frustrating features can be the difference between time spent on debugging and time spent on deployment.\n\nIn this course, you will go deeper than an introductory book to learn the various features that make Go unique. You’ll learn how to protect against the bugs caused by poorly defined variables (and variable shadowing), how Go treats slicers and arrays similarly, and how to work with multidimensional datasets. You’ll also dive into memory handling, strings, loops, and goroutines.\n\nThis course will be most useful if you already have a basic understanding of Go and its syntax. By the end of the course, you’ll move from Go-familiar to Go-expert.",
